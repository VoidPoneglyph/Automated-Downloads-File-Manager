# Automated-Downloads-File-Manager
I made an executable file that when  run, will automatically push the files that are downloaded to specified folders. In order for the code to run infinitely until instructed to stop, I put a while True loop that iterates the entirety of the code with a pause of 1 second. A keyboard interruption was added to stop the loop.
